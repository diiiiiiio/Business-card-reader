## 1. Introduction

The project addresses the pervasive inefficiency of manually managing business cards. In an increasingly digital world, relying on physical cards for contact information leads to time-consuming data entry, potential for human error, and physical clutter. BCR provides an intelligent solution by offering a web application that can scan business cards, automatically extract crucial contact details (name, company, phone, email), and store them in a personalized digital wallet, enhancing data accuracy and accessibility.

## 2. Features

*   **User Authentication:** Simple login system to provide a personalized, secure space for each user's contacts.
*   **Live Scan & Image Upload:** Capture business card images directly via a live camera feed or upload existing image files.
*   **Automated Card Detection:** Real-time detection of business cards within the image, supporting both single and multiple cards in one frame.
*   **Information Extraction:** Advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to accurately extract structured information (name, company, phone number, email) from detected cards.
*   **Manual Correction:** Intuitive interface to review and manually edit any extracted information for accuracy.
*   **Digital Card Wallet:** A dedicated "My Cards" section to view, manage, and remove saved business card contacts.
*   **Robust Data Augmentation:** Utilizes `albumentations` library to significantly expand the training dataset and improve model generalization.

## 3. Project Architecture Overview

The BCR system follows a modular architecture:

1.  **User Interface (Frontend):** A web-based application provides the user-facing interface for login, scanning, editing, and managing cards.
2.  **Backend Server:** Handles user requests, interacts with the deep learning model, processes data, and manages the database.
3.  **Object Detection Module:** Employs a trained YOLOv8 model to identify and localize business cards within captured images.
4.  **Information Extraction Pipeline:** Consists of an OCR component to convert images to text, followed by an NLP/LLM (specifically OpenAI API) to parse and categorize the extracted text into structured contact information.
5.  **Database:** A user-specific JSON-based database for storing digitized business card details.

**Workflow:**
*   **Login:** User logs in with their email/username and password.
*   **Capture Image:** User captures an image of a business card via live camera feed or uploads one.
*   **Card Detection:** The YOLOv8 model detects business cards and draws bounding boxes around them.
*   **Image Cropping & Processing:** Detected card regions are cropped and sent to the OpenAI API.
*   **Information Extraction & Classification:** The OpenAI API extracts and categorizes contact information (name, company, phone, email).
*   **Edit & Save:** Extracted information is displayed for user review and manual correction before being saved to the user's personal database.
*   **View & Manage:** Users can access their saved contacts in the "My Cards" section.

## 4. Dataset

The dataset primarily consists of business card images collected and annotated by the team.

*   **Initial Collection:** A custom dataset was manually compiled by photographing various business cards from team members' contacts. The initial goal was over 200 images, though approximately 54 served as the core base.
*   **Annotation:** All images were meticulously annotated with bounding boxes for cards and specific entities using CVAT, with annotations stored in **YOLO format (.txt files)**.
*   **Preprocessing:** Images were resized (640x640 or 1024x1024 pixels) and subjected to grayscale conversion and normalization.
*   **Data Augmentation:** To significantly enhance model robustness and generalizability, extensive data augmentation was performed using the `albumentations` library. This pipeline generates a large volume of additional training images (targeting over 3000 total images from the base 54) through transformations like horizontal flips, random brightness/contrast, rotations, shifts, and scaling. While external Kaggle datasets were explored, the primary focus for dataset expansion remained on this robust augmentation strategy.

## 5. CNN Architecture Design

We employed the **YOLOv8** object detection framework with a **CSPDarknet** backbone. Through experimentation with three CNN configurations, we aimed to optimize performance:

*   **CNN-1 (Baseline):** Input 640x640, no augmentation, confidence threshold 0.6.
*   **CNN-2 (Augmented):** Input 640x640, built-in YOLO augmentation, confidence threshold 0.6.
*   **CNN-3 (High-Resolution + Fine-Tuning) - Final Chosen Architecture:**
    *   **Input Size:** Increased to 1024x1024 for capturing finer details.
    *   **Augmentation:** Extensive data augmentation using `albumentations`.
    *   **Confidence Threshold:** Reduced from 0.6 to **0.3** to improve sensitivity for detecting more potential objects, including small or partially obscured cards.
    *   **Purpose:** This configuration was chosen for its ability to capture all business cards while maintaining acceptable accuracy, enhancing small-object detection accuracy and overall model sensitivity.

## 6. GUI Design

The application's GUI is a web-based prototype, organized into four main components:

*   **Login Page:** Provides email/username and password fields with "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons for user authentication.
*   **Scanning Page:** Displays a live camera feed for capturing business card images. Includes "Capture Image" and "Logout" buttons. This page also presents the detected cards with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
*   **Edit Page:** After detection, extracted information (Name, Company Name, Phone Number, Email) is pre-filled into editable text fields, alongside a small image of the card. Users can manually correct any errors and save changes.
*   **My Cards Page (Results Page):** Displays a list of all saved business cards, each with its image and extracted details. This acts as the user's digital contact wallet.

*(For detailed screenshots of each page, please refer to the project report's "2.3 GUI Design" section.)*

## 7. Installation

To set up and run the BCR application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd BusinessCardReader
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: `requirements.txt` should contain `torch`, `torchvision`, `ultralytics` (for YOLOv8), `opencv-python`, `albumentations`, `python-dotenv` (for API keys), and any web framework dependencies like `Flask` or `Django`.)*

4.  **Set up OpenAI API Key:**
    *   Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    *   Add your API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ```

5.  **Prepare Dataset (if running training locally):**
    *   Ensure your `dataset/images` and `dataset/labels` directories are populated with your base images and YOLO-formatted annotations.
    *   Run the data augmentation script (e.g., `albumentations_augmentation.py`) to generate augmented data into `augmented_dataset/images/train` and `augmented_dataset/labels/train`.
    *   (Details on specific training scripts would go here if training is part of the local setup.)

The demo showcases the full user journey from login, live scanning and detection, automatic information extraction, manual editing, and finally, saving and viewing contacts in the digital wallet.

## 10. Limitations

*   **Angle Sensitivity:** Model accuracy decreases with images captured from highly unconventional or aggressive angles, indicating a need for more diverse angular training data.
*   **Background Interference:** Performance degrades when business cards closely match background colors or textures, sometimes leading to missed detections or inaccurate cropping.
*   **False Positives:** The model occasionally misclassifies other rectangular objects (e.g., remote controls, phones) as business cards.
*   **Limited Entity Extraction:** Currently extracts only core contact details (name, company, phone, email); does not extract job titles, full addresses, or social media links.
*   **Dataset Diversity:** Despite augmentation, the relatively small original custom dataset might limit generalizability to a wider variety of global business card designs and scripts not encountered during training.
*   **Database Scalability:** The JSON-based database, while functional for individual users, may not be suitable for large-scale production environments with extensive user bases and data volumes.

## 11. Future Enhancements

*   **Expanded & Diversified Dataset:** Integrate larger public datasets and implement more advanced data collection methods to improve model generalization.
*   **Enhanced Object Detection:** Explore more robust detection techniques or ensemble methods for challenging conditions and reduced false positives.
*   **Comprehensive Information Extraction:** Expand entity recognition to include job titles, full addresses, and social media links. Improve multilingual OCR and NLP capabilities.
*   **Scalable Backend & Database:** Transition to a more robust database solution (e.g., SQL or NoSQL) and implement a full-fledged user authentication system for better scalability and security.
*   **Additional Features:** Implement batch card processing, QR code scanning, direct actions (call, email, navigate), and integration with external CRM or contact management platforms.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize image processing, model inference speed, and overall application responsiveness.
